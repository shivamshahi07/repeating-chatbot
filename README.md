# Voice-Enabled Chatbot
This is a project built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), a framework for building server-side applications.
This is a voice-enabled chatbot built using Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and deployed on Vercel. The chatbot listens to the user's voice, converts it to text using the Web Speech API, and responds by repeating the same text back to the user using text-to-speech. The UI is designed to simulate a chatbot interface.
## Features
- Speech Recognition: The app captures the user's voice and converts it to text.
- Text-to-Speech: Once the text is captured, it is repeated back using a different voice.
- Voice Selection: Users can select from different available voices.
- Responsive UI: The chatbot interface is built with Tailwind CSS and is responsive across different devices.

## Technologies Used
- Next.js: A React-based framework for building server-side applications.
- TypeScript: A strongly typed language that compiles to JavaScript.
- Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework that provides pre-built classes for rapid UI development.
- Web Speech API: A web API that allows web applications to access the user's microphone and speech recognition capabilities.
Speech Recognition: Converts spoken words into text.
Speech Synthesis: Converts text to speech using different voice options.

- Vercel: A cloud platform for hosting and deploying web applications.
